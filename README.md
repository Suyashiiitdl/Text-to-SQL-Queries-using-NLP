The Python script leverages a pre-trained model hosted on Hugging Face (KN123/nl2sql) to convert natural language text into SQL queries. This facilitates intuitive interaction with databases by allowing users to input queries in everyday language, which the model then translates into executable SQL code.


Model Details
● Model Source: Hugging Face Transformers
● Model ID: `KN123/nl2sql`
● Type: Seq2Seq (Sequence-to-Sequence)
● Purpose: The model is designed to convert natural language questions or commands into SQL queries, enabling users to interact with databases without specific SQL knowledge.

Pipeline and Direct Model Loading

The code utilizes the pipeline function from the transformers library for a straightforward application of the model, which simplifies the process of generating SQL queries from text. Additionally, the code demonstrates direct loading of model and tokenizer, providing more control over the encoding and decoding processes, which is crucial for custom implementations or when fine-tuning is necessary.

Database Integration

The script interacts with an SQLite database, demonstrating the creation of a table and insertion of data, which showcases a practical application of the model in handling dynamic database content. The user's script automatically populates the database with randomly generated sales data, enabling practical demonstrations of the model's capabilities in a controlled environment.
